# Disctrack
Ultimate Frisbee Stat Tracking App

This Python app leverages the TKinter graphics library to track catches & possessions over the course of a frisbee game/scrimmage,
with the goal of collecting data on a team's performance to perform analysis. It is best used alongside game-footage for ease of data collection.

The app works by selecting the people on both teams:

Then choosing which team begins with the frisbee and the direction they are attacking

Then you simply click along with which person catches the frisbee & whether there's a goal or turnover:
